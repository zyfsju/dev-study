1. Find all combinations and permutations. -> DFS

  - visited when forming the current permutation/path
  - cuurent permutation/path
  - all permutations/paths

3. How many permutations -> DP

Examples:
- DP: How many ways from top-left to bottom-right
- Recursion: return all paths from top-left to bottom-right

BFS probably cannot be implemented with recursion

Shortest Path in weighted graphs, static planning
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A*

potential field for dynamic path planning
